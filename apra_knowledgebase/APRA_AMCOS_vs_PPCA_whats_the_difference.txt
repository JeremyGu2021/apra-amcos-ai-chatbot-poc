While APRA AMCOS administers the performing and some of the reproduction rights in songs and compositions, the PPCA (Phonographic Performance Company of Australia Limited) administers the performing right in ‘sound recordings’ on behalf of record companies and recording artists. Take the song ‘Friday On My Mind’ by The Easybeats as an example. Harry Vanda and George Young
wrote ‘Friday On My Mind’ in 1966. However, in 2008, Ben Lee released a cover version of the song ‘Friday On My Mind,’ as part of a tribute album. So we collected royalties for Harry Vanda and George Young because they wrote the song, while the PPCA collected royalties for Ben Lee’s record label because they released the recording.

The Phonographic Performance Company of Australia Limited (PPCA) is a national, non- governmental organisation that represents the interest of record companies and Australian recording artists.
PPCA administers the copyright of thousands of Australian recording artists and hundreds of labels, both major and independent, ensuring that they receive a fair return for the use of their recorded music.
OneMusic Australia is a joint licensing initiative between APRA AMCOS and PPCA, which provides music users with a ‘one stop shop’ for the licensing of music, covering both the written musical works (APRA AMCOS) and the recordings of those musical works (PPCA).
