If your dispute involves a disagreement between you and another writer or publisher member of APRA (for example, if you and another APRA writer disagree on the ownership percentage of a work that has been registered with APRA), please contact writer@apra.com.au in the first instance.
Our writer services team will contact the other member(s) and see if the dispute can be resolved between the parties. In some instances, we might recommend the dispute be referred to the independent third-party alternative dispute resolution facilitator, Resolution Pathways.
If you wish to participate in alternative dispute resolution with Resolution Pathways, APRA AMCOS can contact Resolution Pathways to start the process, or you can contact them directly. You can find more about this process on the Resolution Pathways website.
