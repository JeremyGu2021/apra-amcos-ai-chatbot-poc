Copyright is free and automatic. Copyright is there from the moment you write down or record the song you've created. The Australian Copyright Act (1968) gives music copyright owners several exclusive rights. Nobody else can use the work without getting the owner’s permission first, and if necessary, paying a royalty for this use. APRA AMCOS represents 2 basic rights that apply to songs and compositions.
Performing right (APRA)
The PERFORMING right is exercised when a song or composition is performed in public.
This includes:
Played live at a gig, concert, or festival. Broadcast on TV or radio
Streamed on digital services. Played in a shop or restaurant. Viewed on YouTube.
Used in an exercise class.
Reproduction right (AMCOS)
The 'Reproduction right' is exercised when a song or composition is copied in any form for commercial purposes.
This includes:
Third party commercial products (e.g. a record label via CD, vinyl, DVD, cassette, stream, and download)
Synchronising an existing song with a film or TV programme
Sheet music

You do not need to register your work, pay any fees, or fill in any forms for it to be protected. Copyright protection is free and automatic, both in Australia and overseas. As soon as you write down your lyrics or music, or record it in any format, it will be protected by copyright. The only requirement is that the work is original (ie: it is not copied) and the result of some skill or effort on your part.
You also do not need a copyright notice on your work for it to be protected. However, it is advisable to warn people that you own the rights in the work. The notice is the copyright symbol ©, your name (and the names of other co-creators), and the year in which the work was created or published. For example: ©
John Brown, Jenny Black, Jackie Green 2008. You should mark all copies (print and recorded) with this notice.
It is rare that disputes arise about who owns the copyright in a work, but if this occurs, you do need to be able to prove that you created the work. The best evidence of this would be early drafts or recordings of the work as well as diaries detailing its development.

What are exceptions?
When you don’t need permission:
Public Domain
Not using a substantial part (quality counts – not quantity. Any important or distinctive part would be an infringement & how original your new piece is counts too).
Fair dealing –
5 very narrow uses:
criticism / review, or parody / satire, reporting the news, teaching.

You do not need to register your work, pay any fees, or fill in any forms for it to be protected. Copyright protection is automatic, both in Australia and overseas.
As soon as you write down your lyrics or music, or record it onto any medium, such as MP3, CD or tape, it is protected by copyright.
The only requirement is that the work be original (i.e. it is not copied) and the result of some skill or effort on your part.
The life of copyright in the Australasian territories is 70 years.
This means that the composer, their Publisher or their estate is entitled to receive royalties for their work for up to 70 years from the date of their death.
Once the 70 years has passed, the work passes to the Public Domain. It can then be used without a fee and without requiring
permission from the composer or their estate.
