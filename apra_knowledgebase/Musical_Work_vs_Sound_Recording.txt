A recorded song has two forms of copyright. One is for the underlying composition (the musical work), the other is for the recording (the sound recording).
The musical work information relates to the songwriter (which can be someone different to the performer) and their publisher; the performance royalties for musical works are collected and paid by APRA and the mechanical royalty is collected by either AMCOS, the publisher or the songwriter.
The sound recording information relates to the artist/performer and the record label involved in the recording and production of a song.
Performance royalties for sound recordings are collected and paid by the PPCA, and the mechanical (sale) royalties are collected and paid by ARIA or record companies.

Text from the Mega Book
When a song is recorded, copyright protects two parts separately:
- There is copyright for the composition / words and music.
- There is separate copyright for the actual sound recording or ‘master’.
APRA AMCOS does not manage the copyright in the sound recording. The public performance of the sound recording is administered by the PPCA in Australia and Recorded Music NZ in New Zealand. The reproduction of your sound recording may be managed by your record label or digital aggregator.
The actual composition is different to the sound recording and there may be people who could ask for shares in the recording. These include engineers, producers, and session musicians. You don't have to give these people a share, however these agreements should be negotiated. It’s common to create a contract to show these parties that their payment or compensation for the recording is one time only and there will be no ongoing royalties. The crucial thing is to get agreements written and recorded in some form.
