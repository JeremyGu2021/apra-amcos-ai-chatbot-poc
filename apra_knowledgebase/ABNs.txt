Once you become a member, make sure you tell us your Australian Business Number (ABN).
If you don’t have an ABN, get one! We can
only accept Individual/Sole Trader ABNs. If you don’t have an ABN and you earn more than
$500 in APRA royalties or $75 in AMCOS royalties, we deduct withholding tax from your royalties at the highest marginal rate for personal income tax. Apply for an ABN
through the Australian Business Register.

Text from the Mega Book
ABN (Australian tax residents only)
Once you start earning money from your music you may find you need to operate as a business and get an ABN – which is free from:
https://www.abr.gov.au/business-super-funds-charities/applying-abn. 
However, it is not mandatory to have an ABN to apply for APRA or AMCOS membership. The ABN on your APRA AMCOS account must be a sole trader ABN. This is because legally you as an individual wrote the music (or shares in the music) that APRA and AMCOS are paying you royalties for. Therefore, your APRA AMCOS membership must be in your full legal name and royalty earnings declared to the Australian Tax Office (ATO) under a sole trader ABN in your legal name. You can add a sole trader ABN to your APRA AMCOS account by contacting us any time.
The ATO has stipulated that without an ABN, Pay As You Go (PAYG) Tax of 47% must be applied to all APRA payments of $500+ and AMCOS payments of $75+. This tax is then claimed back on your annual tax return. Speak with your accountant for more information.

If you earn over $500 from APRA or $75 from AMCOS, we require your account to have an Individual or Sole Trader ABN.
Otherwise, APRA AMCOS is obliged by law to withhold 47% in PAYG tax from those payments. (This can be claimed back in your tax return.)
If you have an Individual/Sole Trader ABN, or acquire one, please email writer@apra.com.au and the team will ensure that your membership file is updated.
